Merge kill maps into one map for analysis

Combine dev test methods and auto-gen test methods

Determine which project-versions to use? - 5+ suites only

Valid_mut_bugs --> bugs with min 1 suite with t test.

Only merge bugs/suites that are in the valid_bugs file (and havent failed?? - Maybe search success log for Min 5 matching suite that mutated) 

Check space before runnning scripts

352 - Success
57 - Timeout

Decided to redo with each map having its own directory in case sed pipes conflict, also redid with 110 walltime.

409 submitted - 2020-08-10
384 - COMPLETED
25 - TIMEOUT

Removed the 25 timeouts using the log file
Reran these with wall time of 10 days. A lot of suites ended on Randoop-4 so will probably only need an extra day or two
